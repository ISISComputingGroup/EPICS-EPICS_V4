<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>pvDatabaseRPC is an example of a pvAccess server that has a PVRecord that supports Channel RPC as well as
the usual operations: Channel Get, Put and Monitor and get introspection
data.</p>

<p>It illustrates synchronous and asynchronous RPC services, selecting services
based on the supplied pvRequest and using EPICS V4 to talk to an existing
object which has no knowledge of EPICS and call its methods, so creating 
distributed objects.</p>

<p>It represents a device which has a 2D position setpoint and readback as well
as a state. The device can be controlled through a client using RPC commands
to move through a sequence of points as well as conventionally by putting to
the setpoint.</p>

<h2>Start Service</h2>

<p>In the exampleJava/pvDatabaseRPC directory</p>

<p>On Linux</p>

<pre><code>./bin/$EPICS_HOST_ARCH/exampleRPCMain
</code></pre>


<h2>Set position using pvput</h2>

<p>When the device is in the idle state its setpoint can be set using a Channel Put in the conventional way: With pvput in your path</p>

<pre><code>pvput -r positionSP.value mydevice 1 2
</code></pre>
<p>will set the setpoint to the point (1,2).</p>

<h2>To run client (control)</h2>

<p>In the exampleJava/pvDatabaseRPC directory</p>

<p>On Linux</p>

<pre><code>./bin/$EPICS_HOST_ARCH/control &lt;command&gt; [&lt;args&gt;]
</code></pre>

<p>E.g.</p>
<pre><code>./bin/$EPICS_HOST_ARCH/control help
./bin/$EPICS_HOST_ARCH/control configure 1 2 10 20
./bin/$EPICS_HOST_ARCH/control run
./bin/$EPICS_HOST_ARCH/control pause
./bin/$EPICS_HOST_ARCH/control resume
./bin/$EPICS_HOST_ARCH/control rewind 5
./bin/$EPICS_HOST_ARCH/control stop
./bin/$EPICS_HOST_ARCH/control scan
./bin/$EPICS_HOST_ARCH/control abort</code></pre>



<h2>Device and client operation</h2>

<p>The device has 4 states: IDLE, READY, RUNNING and PAUSED.</p>

<p>The state machine is shown below (Intermediate ABORTING and STOPPING states added for clarity).</p>

<IMG src="state_machine.png" alt="State machine"/>

<p>In the IDLE state the device can be controlled in a conventional way by
writing to the positionSP (setpoint) field. The device's positionRB field
(readback) will move to the setpoint. In other states such writes
are ignored. Writes to other fields are always ignored.</p>

<p>From IDLE the command "configure" sets the sequence of points through which
the device will move and changes state to READY.</p>

<p>From READY the command "run" will start the device moving through the sequence
of points and set the state to RUNNING. The command "scan" does the same but
blocks until completion. On successful completion in each case the state will
return to READY. Any motion will stop. </p>

<p>In the RUNNING state "pause" pauses the scan and changes the state to PAUSED.
When PAUSED, "resume" resumes the scan.</p>

<p>When RUNNING or PAUSED "rewind" (which takes an integer argument "n") rewinds
n steps (or to the beginning if n is sufficiently large). If PAUSED the device
will move to the requested rewind position when it resumes.</p>

<p>In any state except IDLE "stop" stops a scan and the state goes to READY.
A "scan" operation in progress will return an error.</p>

<p>In any state "abort" stops any scans in progress (including paused scans) and
the state goes to IDLE. Any configuration information is rest. Any motion will
stop. A "scan" operation in progress will return an error.</p>

<p>The current state appears in the device's structure along with the two
position fields. Each field has a time stamp. There is also a top-level time
stamp.</p>

<p>The record's structure in full is:</p>

            double x
