# exampleCPP

This project provides a set of examples of client and server code for 
pvAccess.
Each example can be built separately by building in the example subdirectory.
The complete set of examples, except for ChannelArchiverService can also be
built by building in exampleCPP itself.

Each example can be used as a template for building other applications:

* Choose an example that is similar to the desired application.
* Copy the complete example to where the desired application should reside.
* Edit the new application.

There is also a test that supports:

    make runtests

This test requires that at least **database** is built.

## Building examples
