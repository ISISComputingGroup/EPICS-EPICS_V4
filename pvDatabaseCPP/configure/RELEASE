# pvDatabaseCPP RELEASE - Location of external support modules
#
# IF YOU CHANGE this file or any file it includes you must
# subsequently do a "gnumake rebuild" in the application's
# top level directory.
#
# The build process does not check dependencies against files
# that are outside this application, thus you should also do a
# "gnumake rebuild" in the top level directory after EPICS_BASE
# or any other external module pointed to below is rebuilt.
#
# Host- or target-specific settings can be given in files named
#  RELEASE.$(EPICS_HOST_ARCH).Common
#  RELEASE.Common.$(T_A)
#  RELEASE.$(EPICS_HOST_ARCH).$(T_A)

# EPICS V4 Developers: Do not edit the locations in this file!
#
# Create a file RELEASE.local pointing to your PVASRV, PVACCESS,
# PVDATA, PVCOMMON and EPICS_BASE build directories, e.g.
#   PVASRV   = /path/to/epics/pvaSrvCPP
#   PVACCESS = /path/to/epics/pvAccessCPP
#   PVDATA   = /path/to/epics/pvDataCPP
#   PVCOMMON = /path/to/epics/pvCommonCPP
#   EPICS_BASE = /path/to/epics/base
