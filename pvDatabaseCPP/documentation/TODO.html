<h1>TODO</h1>
<h2>recordList</h2>
<p>This is putGet support that provides a list of all the records in an IOC.
Since pvAccess implements pvlist this is no longer needed.
Remove it from pvDatabaseCPP and pvIOCCPP.
Also remove channelList from swtshell.</p>
<h2>monitorPlugin</h2>
<p>A debate is on-going about what semantics should be.</p>
<h2>Must test record delete.</h2>
<p>Must test removing a record from the PVDatabase while a pvAccess client
is attached. Also why do both unlisten and detach exists?</p>
<h2>create more regression tests</h2>
<p>Currently only some simple tests exist. Most of the testing has been via the examples</p>
